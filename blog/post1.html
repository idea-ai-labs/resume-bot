    <p>If you’ve ever stared at a blank document wondering how to turn your experiences into a resume that really stands out, you’re not alone. Writing resumes can be tricky—but AI tools are quietly helping job seekers structure and highlight their stories more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Recruiter Expectations</h2>
    <p>Many resumes never make it past the initial scan. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) filter resumes based on format, keywords, and structure. AI tools can guide you in organizing your experiences so they’re both readable for humans and ATS-friendly.</p>

    <h2>Why Job Seekers Benefit</h2>
    <p>For students, recent grads, or career changers, summarizing achievements can be challenging. AI tools act like a smart assistant, suggesting phrasing, highlighting key skills, and polishing formatting—while keeping the content authentically yours.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Using AI Effectively</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Focus on structure, not content. Your achievements come from you.</li>
      <li>Keep your voice authentic. Avoid generic phrasing.</li>
      <li>Experiment. Test different formats and platforms.</li>
    </ol>
